# Supported countries

Every country BlindPay supports, by tier: standard, high-risk (Enhanced KYC required), and prohibited.

Source: https://blindpay.com/docs/kb/supported-countries

BlindPay supports customers and transactions across most countries. Which verification level a customer needs, and whether a country is supported at all, depends on where they are from. Country checks apply to a customer's `country`, `id_doc_country`, and (for businesses) each owner's `id_doc_country`, as well as bank account fields such as the SWIFT beneficiary/bank/intermediary country.

There are three tiers:

| Tier | What it means |
| --- | --- |
| Standard | KYC Standard (individuals) or KYB Standard (businesses) is available. Automated review for eligible individuals. |
| High-risk | Individuals must use KYC Enhanced. Manual review, up to 1 business day. Driver's license is not accepted as an ID document. |
| Prohibited | Not supported. Customer and bank account creation is blocked. |

**Note:**

High-risk status is a soft gate: it raises the KYC requirement, it does not block the country. Prohibited countries are a hard block.

## High-risk countries

Individuals from high-risk countries cannot use `kyc_type: standard`; creating one with `standard` is rejected. They must use `kyc_type: enhanced` instead, which requires the additional Enhanced KYC fields (source of funds, purpose of transactions) and goes through manual review.

- Manual review typically takes up to 1 business day.
- Driver's license (`DRIVERS`) is not accepted as an `id_doc_type` for a high-risk `id_doc_country`; use a passport or national ID card instead.
- Businesses are not gated by this list directly, but a business owner's `id_doc_country` is still checked against the prohibited-country list.

## Prohibited countries

Countries under sanctions or outside BlindPay's risk appetite are not supported at all. Creating a customer, adding a bank account, or setting a SWIFT beneficiary/bank/intermediary country that falls in this tier returns an error and the request is blocked. There is no override or manual exception path for a prohibited country.

**Warning:**

Country tiers are reviewed periodically as sanctions and risk assessments change, so a country's tier can move. Contact [support@blindpay.com](mailto:support@blindpay.com) if you need to confirm a country's current tier before launching there.

## What to build against

Because these tiers can change, avoid hardcoding the list into your own product logic. Instead:

- Let the customer creation call be the source of truth: submit the customer with the country and KYC type you intend, and handle the error response if the country requires a different tier.
- For individuals from high-risk countries, collect the Enhanced KYC fields up front. Enhanced KYC always goes through manual review; there is no fast-path back to standard's automated speed.
