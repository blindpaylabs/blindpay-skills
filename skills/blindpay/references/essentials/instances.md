# Instances

Instances are isolated BlindPay environments, one per stage of your stack, created in the dashboard.

Source: https://blindpay.com/docs/learn/instances

An instance is an isolated BlindPay environment. If your product has separate development, staging, and production environments, create one instance for each. All features live inside an instance: customers, bank accounts, wallets, virtual accounts, payouts, and payins.

Instances are created through the [BlindPay dashboard](https://app.blindpay.com). You cannot create them via the API.

Each instance is either a `development` or `production` instance. Both expose the same features but differ in KYC handling, network availability, and whether fiat actually moves.

**Note:**

All payouts and payins made on development instances skip the real fiat payment rails. Payouts do not move real money, and payins auto-complete a simulated deposit instead of waiting for a real bank transfer.

## Development vs. production

| Feature | Development | Production |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Customers | Supported | Supported |
| Bank accounts | Supported | Supported |
| Payout quotes | Supported | Supported |
| Payouts | Supported (no real fiat movement) | Supported |
| Payin quotes | Supported | Supported |
| Payins | Supported (auto-completes in ~30s) | Supported |
| KYC | Auto-approved | Automated (~60s) or manual review |
| EVM networks | `sepolia`, `base_sepolia`, `arbitrum_sepolia`, `polygon_amoy` | `ethereum`, `base`, `polygon`, `arbitrum` |
| Stellar | Testnet | Mainnet |
| Solana | Devnet | Mainnet |
| Tron | N/A | Mainnet (beta) |
| API keys | Supported | Supported |
| Webhooks | Supported | Supported |

On development instances, use USDB as the test stablecoin: a BlindPay-issued test token that stands in for real USDC or USDT. See [Sandbox vs. production](sandbox-vs-production.md) for the full testing workflow.

## Create an instance

### Open the dashboard

Go to the [BlindPay dashboard](https://app.blindpay.com) and click **Create instance**.

### Choose an environment

Choose whether the new instance is `development` or `production`. Development instances are ready immediately. You can own up to 10 development instances (deleting one doesn't free up a slot); production instances have no fixed cap here.

When creating a development instance, you can turn on **Seed sample data** to populate it with sample customers, bank accounts, blockchain wallets, virtual accounts, and a handful of quotes, payouts, and payins, so the dashboard isn't empty while you explore.

### Wait for activation (production only)

New production instances may take up to 3 business days to set up. See [Cut-off times](../kb/cut-off-times.md) for full SLAs.

## API keys are per-instance

An API key authenticates requests to one instance only. A key created for instance A will not work against instance B, even within the same organization. See [API keys](api-keys.md) to create and manage keys.

## Manage your instance

### Update settings

```bash [cURL]
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://api.blindpay.com/v1/instances/in_000000000000 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "name": "My instance",
    "email_notifications": true,
    "require_passkey": false
  }'
```

Requires the owner or admin role on the instance.

**Warning:**

`name` is required on every call, even when you are only changing one other field. Send the instance's current name along with whatever you are updating, or the request fails with `400`.

| Field | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `name` | string | Required on every call. |
| `email_notifications` | boolean | Defaults to `true`. |
| `require_passkey` | boolean | Defaults to `false`. |
| `customer_rfi_emails_enabled` | boolean, optional | Omit it to leave the current value unchanged; there is no default on update. |
| `compliance_emails` | string[], optional, max 20 | When set, [instance RFI](../kb/instance-requests.md) and customer [RFI](rfi.md) emails go only to these addresses instead of every team member. Send an empty array to go back to notifying the whole team. |
| `customer_invite_redirect_url` | string, optional | Where a customer lands after finishing a hosted onboarding link. |

### Delete an instance

Only the instance's current owner can delete it (`400 user_not_owner` for anyone else). Deleting is a soft delete: the instance stops resolving immediately, but nothing is destroyed on BlindPay's side.

```bash [cURL]
curl --request DELETE \
  --url https://api.blindpay.com/v1/instances/in_000000000000 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## Team members

### List members

```bash [cURL]
curl --url https://api.blindpay.com/v1/instances/in_000000000000/members \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Returns every member of the instance with their `role`.

### Roles

| Role |
| --- |
| `owner` |
| `admin` |
| `finance` |
| `checker` |
| `operations` |
| `developer` |
| `viewer` |

`owner` is never assigned directly: `GET /instances/{id}/members` always reports it for whoever currently owns the instance, overriding whatever role is stored for that member. Use ownership transfer, below, to change who holds it.

### Update a member's role

```bash [cURL]
curl --request PUT \
  --url https://api.blindpay.com/v1/instances/in_000000000000/members/us_000000000000 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "user_role": "developer"
  }'
```

Requires the owner, admin, or checker role on the instance. You cannot change the current owner's role this way: that request is rejected with `400 cannot_update_instance_owner`. Transfer ownership first if you need to change what the owner can do.

### Remove a member

```bash [cURL]
curl --request DELETE \
  --url https://api.blindpay.com/v1/instances/in_000000000000/members/us_000000000000 \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY'
```

Requires the owner or admin role on the instance. The current owner cannot be removed this way (`400 cannot_delete_instance_owner`); transfer ownership first.

### Transfer ownership

```bash [cURL]
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.blindpay.com/v1/instances/in_000000000000/ownership \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "user_id": "us_000000000000"
  }'
```

Only the current owner can transfer ownership, and only to someone who is already a member of the instance (`400 new_owner_not_instance_member` otherwise; `400 already_instance_owner` if you pass yourself). Both accounts end up with the `admin` role in the underlying membership record: `owner` itself is derived from who currently holds ownership, not from a stored role, so the previous owner keeps full admin access after the transfer.

**Note:**

You can pass an `Idempotency-Key` header (up to 255 characters) on any update, delete, or ownership-transfer call on this page. Retrying with the same key and the same body replays the original response instead of repeating the action; the same key with a different body is rejected. Keys are remembered for 24 hours.
